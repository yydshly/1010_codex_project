      'Represents a WWII-production rifle with the gas-port (spline-type) gas cylinder, walnut stock and handguards, Parkerized ' +
      'metal and an M1907 leather sling. Overall and barrel length, length of pull (13 in), sight radius (about 28 in) and the stock ' +
      'and handguard lengths follow published figures; receiver, gas cylinder, sights, bands and swivels are proportioned from those ' +
      'and from the parts nomenclature (FM 23-5: elevating knob on the left, windage knob on the right, safety at the front of the ' +
      'trigger guard, front sling swivel on the stock ferrule, stacking swivel on the gas cylinder). The bolt is shown closed; the ' +
      'en-bloc clip, internal mechanism, markings and cartouches are not modelled. Sling simplified: adjustment holes omitted and the ' +
      'long/short strap junction shown as a D-ring with a short tab.',
