    'The Type 99 was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1939 as the successor to the 6.5 mm Type 38, chambered for the ' +
    'heavier 7.7x58mm cartridge. The short rifle was made in millions; early rifles ' +
    'carried a folding monopod, a sliding dust cover and a rear sight with anti-aircraft lead arms, all simplified away as the war went on.',

    notes:
      'Represents an early / mid-war Type 99 short rifle: blued metal, two-piece stock with the lower butt piece spliced on ' +
      'horizontally, cupped steel butt plate, side-mounted (left) sling swivels, reinforced upper band with the bayonet lug, front ' +
      'sight protectors, ladder rear sight with the anti-aircraft lead arms shown folded, straight bolt handle with the plum-shaped ' +
      'knob, knurled safety knob, optional sliding dust cover and a brown leather sling. Overall and barrel length follow published ' +
      'figures; the stock sections, receiver, sights, bands and swivels are proportioned from photographs, not measured. The folding ' +
      'monopod of early rifles is not fitted (it was frequently removed). The receiver ring is shown plain: the imperial chrysanthemum ' +
      'and all other markings are deliberately omitted. Bolt shown closed; internal mechanism, the Type 30 bayonet and the sling ' +
      'stitching / buckle tongue are not modelled; the sling adjustment is a simplification.',
